00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,020
Hello!
This is Shitao Miu~

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,680
Tada!

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:15,820
I made a map of the places
that I have visited in Yamaguchi!

4
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,900
Yay!
How is it?

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:26,480
Yume hana haku on 24th will be in
the Kirara Dome, right here,

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,180
And the Yamaguchi Tour Concert will be...

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:38,220
around here.
Shuunan Bunka Kaikan. Around here.

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:47,580
So I don't think you can visit
all the places in one day.

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,940
So...

10
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,000
When you come to Kirara Dome on the 24th,

11
00:00:53,465 --> 00:00:56,395
visit half of them,

12
00:00:57,065 --> 00:00:59,985
and when you come to Shuunan Bunka Kaikan,

13
00:00:59,985 --> 00:01:04,660
you can visit this half.

14
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,340
If you are visiting 2 to 3 days or longer,

15
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:14,500
I hope you can visit all the places.

16
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:21,640
Especially the Himawari(Sunflower) Road and
Tsunoshima are good places to visit in summer,

17
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,820
so if you have the chance to visit Yamaguchi in summer,
please visit thouse places

18
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,840
You can probably enjoy Tsunoshima
any time of the year.

19
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,340
Let me tell you about the places
that I especially recommend.

20
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,700
My favourite place is...

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,740
this place: Irori Sanzoku.

22
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,620
It's in the mountains

23
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:47,660
It's a restaurant..

24
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,900
It's like a restaurant in the mountains.
It's a wonderful place,

25
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,860
so please visit.

26
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,900
Perhaps not on rainy days.

27
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:09,040
And there are also soul foods,
like kawarasoba, or barisoba.
So I hope you get a chance to taste them.

28
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,660
And my favourite: Toushirou

29
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,680
It's a place that sells uirou
(a kind of Japanese dessert)

30
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:21,280
You can find it in the airport,
so please, please, bring it home as a souvenier!

31
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:28,320
I recommend the nama uirou so... try that one

32
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,800
Is that all...?

33
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,940
So please visit Yamaguchi with this map!
I'll wait for you~~
